Emphasis on building.</p>\n<p>Wisr is an ongoing project – our team is constantly thinking about, designing, and building new features. We are collecting feedback from our customers and our members, and we’re iterating on existing features to make them more intuitive.</p>\n<p>We try to move quickly, and we understand that you are busy. As a Wisr admin it can be hard to keep up with all of the big features, enhancements, and small tweaks we make. Often when we release an update, your students and alumni may see it before you do – they are the ones using Wisr every day to make meaningful connections.</p>\n<p>Building Wisr is a space where we, the Wisr Product and Engineering teams, can keep you up-to-date on what we are building. As we release new and important updates to Wisr, we will tell you about it here. Our goal is not just to tell you that we built a new thing, but to explain <em>why</em> we built it. When you meet with a member of your Wisr network, maybe in a career services advising session, or at an alumni event, we want to make sure that you know everything there is to know about Wisr.</p>\n<p>We are excited to share some insight into what we are creating.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading.</p>\n<p>P.S. If you have thoughts, ideas, feedback, questions or just want to chat, you can talk to us any time at <a href="support@wisr.io">support@wisr.io</a></p>',frontmatter:{title:"Hello There",date:"May 05, 2018",published:!0}}},pathContext:{slug:"/hello-there/",previous:null,next:{fields:{slug:"/a-new-way-to-explore/"},frontmatter:{title:"A New Way to Explore",published:!0}}}}}});
