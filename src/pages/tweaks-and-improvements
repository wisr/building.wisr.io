We are excited to share a few important improvements that we’ve made to improve the member experience in your Wisr networks.



### Chat Messaging

We’ve gotten a lot of really great feedback on the Chat interface, and we’re glad to report that we heard you and we listened. Here are a few of the changes you’ll notice the next time you send a message in Wisr: 

- A more helpful “zero-state” chat screen. When you click the **Send a Message** button and land in a new chat conversation with a person, there’s now helpful text and a link to an [article on how to write a great introductory message](https://help.wisr.io/messaging/sending-a-professional-introductory-message). We hope this helps move the conversation forward for those individuals who aren’t quite sure how to get started.

- The text bar will now grow as you type, making it easier to review and edit your message before sending.
- Previously, clicking enter on a chat message would send the message. Now, hitting enter will start a new paragraph. To send your chat message, either click the paper plane icon, or select Command + Enter.


### Scheduling a Call

We’re excited to share that we’ve released a new feature called **Subschools** to help address this issue and make it easier for our partner institutions to track and maintain consistent degree information for their alumni and students. With the feature, there’s a new column for **Subschool** in your education data file to optionally specify the particular ‘sub’ school or college that is associated with each degree that a person earns.

For example, at Wisr University, an alum may have a:

- B.A. in Marketing from the **College of Liberal Arts and Sciences** and an 
- M.S. in Statistics from the **Graduate School of Social Sciences**

In addition to capturing _more contextual degree data_, this new feature also eases the reporting burden for site admins. This field is available in the members table, so they can now run a report for all alumni or students who’ve signed up for Wisr from a particular school or college, without needing to run a check against their entire CRM.

Curious if the **Subschool** feature is something you’d like to turn on for your institution? Reach out to your Wisr Customer Success Manager to see if it’s right for you.

## A New Way to Help

And lastly, we’ve added a new optional _Way to Help_ that has been highly requested by many of the admins and faculty at our partner schools. It is:

**_Speaking on a panel or in a classroom_**

This selection will show up on members’ profiles and as an option to filter search results. This will make it extremely easy for faculty and staff to quickly identify alumni that are willing to volunteer their time and expertise to participate on a career-related panel or in the classroom to talk with students.
