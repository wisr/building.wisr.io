We are excited to share a few important improvements that we’ve made to improve the member experience in your Wisr networks.

### Chat Messaging

We’ve gotten a lot of really great feedback on the Chat interface, and we’re glad to report that we heard you and we listened. Here are a few of the changes you’ll notice the next time you send a message in Wisr: 

- A more helpful “zero-state” chat screen. When you click the **Send a Message** button and land in a new chat conversation with a person, there’s now helpful text and a link to an [article on how to write a great introductory message](https://help.wisr.io/messaging/sending-a-professional-introductory-message). We hope this helps move the conversation forward for those individuals who aren’t quite sure how to get started.

- The text bar will now grow as you type, making it easier to review and edit your message before sending.
- Previously, clicking enter on a chat message would send the message. Now, hitting enter will start a new paragraph. To send your chat message, either click the paper plane icon, or select Command + Enter.


### Scheduling a Call

We’re excited to share that we’ve released a new feature called **Subschools** to help address this issue and make it easier for our partner institutions to track and maintain consistent degree information for their alumni and students. With the feature, there’s a new column for **Subschool** in your education data file to optionally specify the particular ‘sub’ school or college that is associated with each degree that a person earns.
