Here are a few of the changes you’ll notice the next time you send a message in Wisr: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A more helpful “zero-state” chat screen. When you click the <strong>Send a Message</strong> button and land in a new chat conversation with a person, there’s now helpful text and a link to an <a href="https://help.wisr.io/messaging/sending-a-professional-introductory-message">article on how to write a great introductory message</a>. We hope this helps move the conversation forward for those individuals who aren’t quite sure how to get started.\n<img src="./subschool-file.png" alt="Image of empty chat message screen with new help language"></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The text bar will now grow as you type, making it easier to review and edit your message before sending.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Previously, clicking enter on a chat message would send the message. Now, hitting enter will start a new paragraph. To send your chat message, either click the paper plane icon, or select Command + Enter.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Scheduling a Call</h3>\n<p>We’re excited to share that we’ve released a new feature called <strong>Subschools</strong> to help address this issue and make it easier for our partner institutions to track and maintain consistent degree information for their alumni and students. With the feature, there’s a new column for <strong>Subschool</strong> in your education data file to optionally specify the particular ‘sub’ school or college that is associated with each degree that a person earns.</p>\n<p><img src="./subschool-file.png" alt="Image of CSV file for Wisr&#x27;s new education data append with a subschool column"></p>',frontmatter:{title:"New Tweaks and Improvements",date:"August 19, 2018",published:!1}}},pathContext:{slug:"/new-tweaks-and-improvements/",previous:{fields:{slug:"/start-the-conversation-with-discussions/"},frontmatter:{title:"Start the Conversation with Discussions",published:!0}},next:null}}}});
